# About 📌

This is a classic CS project conceived as an introduction to the basics of threading a process. It gives an introductory glance into the difficulties contingent to the non-deterministic nature of multi-threaded application programming.

## `philosophers` Problem 🜎

*  **One or more philosophers** sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

* The philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, or sleeping:
	- While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
	- while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
	- While sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
* There are also **forks** on the table. There are **as many forks as philosophers**.
* A philosopher **must take two forks to eat**, one in each hand.
* When finished eating, they **put their forks back on the table** and start sleeping. 
* Once awake, they start thinking again. 
* The simulation **stops** when a philosopher **dies of starvation**.
* Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
* Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
* Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.
